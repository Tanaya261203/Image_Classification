# Image_Classification
IMAGE CLASSIFICATION USING DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHM
# Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset, leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for improved performance. The goal is to classify images into 10 distinct categories (airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, etc.) by training a CNN model and evaluating its accuracy.

# CIFAR-10 Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset is a collection of 60,000 32x32 color images labeled into 10 different classes. It is widely used for training image classification models. The dataset is divided into two parts:

Training set: 50,000 images
Test set: 10,000 images
The classes are as follows:

Airplane
Automobile
Bird
Cat
Deer
Dog
Frog
Horse
Ship
Truck
# Requirements/Libraries to run this project, you need the following Python libraries:

TensorFlow/Keras - For building and training the CNN model
NumPy - For numerical operations
Matplotlib - For visualizing the data and model performance
Pandas - For data manipulation (if needed)
Scikit-learn - For model evaluation (optional)
